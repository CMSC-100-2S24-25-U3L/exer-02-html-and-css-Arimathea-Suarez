                        I am an only child who has always dedicated myself to learning new things, such as designing and software development, since I began my studies at university. This journey was inspired by my father’s influence to pursue programming. My journey began in learning Python during my first semester, and since then, I’ve always strived to familiarize myself with and practice the programming languages used in different subjects. Moreover, I’ve devoted my time and passion to mastering various programming languages.

                        It started with using mathematical modeling and optimization techniques, applying them to projects like ticket pricing using Gaussian elimination and the Simplex Method. I also developed a restaurant management system in Java, focusing on object-oriented principles like inheritance and abstraction, and later integrated concurrency into a gacha game simulator using multithreading.

                        Throughout my journey, I have encountered both physical and mental challenges, which have tested and proven my resilience. These experiences have further strengthened my determination to overcome obstacles and improve my problem-solving skills.

                        My expertise extends to C programming, where I have worked with data structures such as AVL and binary search trees, and implemented heap operations. I also explore scientific computing with R, creating predictive models using polynomial regression. In light of these, I'm constantly looking for new challenges and chances to learn more, especially when it comes to creating dynamic apps using frameworks like JavaFX. As a result, this programming adventure is a part of my life that should be chronicled indefinitely. Who knows? Maybe as time goes on, I'll grow to love programming even more, which can be an asset that can be utilized in future times.
